Musicly is a desktop music player created with Visual Studio 2019, C# and [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio).
I developed Musicly as a way for myself to enjoy music while studying, coding, etc ðŸ˜Š.

## âš™ Technologies used:
- Visual Studio 2019
- C#

## ðŸ“– How To Use:
- Firstly, you'll need to install Visual Studio from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).  

<b>The app has NO setup, so this is a Visual Studio project you're gonna run here.</b>  

- You'll also need to install [Mont Font](https://www.dafont.com/mont.font) in order for the UI to display properly.  

- Secondly, run the app in Visual Studio. The application window'll open just like so:

- From here click the "Select Songs" button. You'll be prompted to choose one or multiple .mp3 or .wav files.
  
Do **NOT** choose any other file format.  
Although you can, trying to play any other file format will result in a crash as I'll discuss later on.  
For now just stick to those two.

- After selecting your music tracks, simply choose the track you want to play from the list and hit play.  

- **Auto Play** is on by default so it'll move automatically to the next track.  

- The player has the most basic mp3 player features including a loop button which, if checked, will loop the music track over and over.

## Known issues
- If a file that isn't audio is played using the previous or next buttons, the program will crash!
This issue is currently in the fix.

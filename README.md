Musicly is an mp3 player interface created with Visual Studio 2019, C# and [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio).

## âš™ Technologies used:
- Visual Studio 2019
- C#

## How To Use:
Firstly, you'll need to install Visual Studio from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).  

The app has NO setup, so this is a Visual Studio project you're gonna run here.  

You'll also need to install [Mont Font](https://www.dafont.com/mont.font) in order for the UI to display properly.  

Secondly, run the app in Visual Studio. The application window'll open just like so:

From here click the "Select Songs" button. You'll be prompted to choose one or multiple .mp3 or .wav files.
  
Do **NOT** choose any other file format.  
Although you can, trying to play any other file format will result in a crash as I'll discuss later on.  
For now just stick to those two.

After selecting your music tracks, simply choose the track you want to play from the list and hit play.  

**Auto Play** is on by default so it'll move automatically to the next track.  

The player has the most basic mp3 player features including a loop button which, if checked, will loop the music track over and over.
